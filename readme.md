# Noughts and crosses

Exercise: I was asked to read Addy Osmani's _JavaScript design patterns_ book, choose a pattern and build something in JS using that pattern. I chose the [observer pattern](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#observerpatternjavascript) and built this game of noughts and crosses. 

I thought it would be nice to have a variable sized board, so if you change the value of `initNum` at the top of the script you can get any size you like. By default it's set to 4.

The code isn't pretty and there's not a hint of ES6+ in it; please bear in mind this is a junior level exercise written in 2015 XD
